Adds a 'Post to Yahoo! Meme' button to your wordpress pages/post.

== Description ==

Memepost is a wordpress plugin which lets you add a 'Memepost' or 'Post to Meme' or 'MemeThis' or 'MemeIt' button to your wordpress posts.

**Demo:** Live demo of this plugin can be seen [here](http://gofedora.com/).

**Features**

    *  Easy to setup. Copy, Activate, Setup and Go :)
    *  No dependencies.
    *  Option to configure button text.
    *  Option to control the location of button on a post.
    *  Option to enable/disable button per post/page.
    *  Options to noindex/nofollow memepost button.
    *  Supports internationalization (i18n).


**Usage**

There are three ways you can add the memepost button. Automatic way, manual way and using shortcodes.

#### Automatic way

Install the Plugin and choose the type and position of the button from the Pluginâ€™s settings page. You can also specifically enable/disable the button for each post or page from the write post/page screen.

#### Manual way

If you want more control over the way the button should be positioned, then you can manually call the button using the following code.

if (function_exists('memepost_button')) echo memepost_button();

#### Using shortcodes

You can also place the shortcode [memepost] anywhere in your post. This shortcode will be replaced by the button when the post is rendered.

[Kulbir Saini](http://gofedora.com/) - This plugin is completely inspired from [Easy Retweet](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-retweet/). Basically the code was just copied and modified to support Yahoo! Meme and then a few more features were added.
